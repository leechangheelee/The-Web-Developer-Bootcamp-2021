    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are marine <a href="#nowhere">molluscs</a> of the order Sepiida. They belong to the
        class Cephalopoda, which
        also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which
        is used for control of buoyancy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators
        include dolphins, sharks, fish, seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The typical life expectancy of a
        cuttlefish is about 1â€“2 years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent
        invertebrates.[4] Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.[4]

    <p>
        The "cuttle" in cuttlefish comes from the Old English name for the species, cudele, which may be cognate with
        the Old Norse koddi (cushion) and the Middle Low German Kudel (rag).[5] The Greco-Roman world valued the
        cuttlefish as a source of the unique brown pigment the creature releases from its siphon when it is alarmed. The
        word for it in both Greek and Latin, sepia, now refers to the reddish-brown color sepia in English.

    <h2>Range and habitat</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and temperate ocean waters. They are
        mostly shallow-water animals, although they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).[10] They have
        an unusual biogeographic pattern; they are present along the coasts of East and South Asia, Western Europe, and
        the Mediterranean, as well as all coasts of Africa and Australia, but are totally absent from the Americas. By
        the time the family evolved, ostensibly in the Old World, the North Atlantic possibly had become too cold and
        deep for these warm-water species to cross.[11] The common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), is found in the
        Mediterranean, North and Baltic seas, although populations may occur as far south as South Africa.

    <h2>Anatomy and physiology</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Visual system</h3>
    <p>Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes. The organogenesis and the final structure of the
        cephalopod eye fundamentally differ from those of vertebrates such as humans.[14] Superficial similarities
        between cephalopod and vertebrate eyes are thought to be examples of convergent evolution. The cuttlefish pupil
        is a smoothly curving W-shape.[15][16] Although cuttlefish cannot see color,[17] they can perceive the
        polarization of light, which enhances their perception of contrast. They have two spots of concentrated sensor
        cells on their retinas (known as foveae), one to look more forward, and one to look more backward. The eye
        changes focus by shifting the position of the entire lens with respect to the retina, instead of reshaping the
        lens as in mammals. Unlike the vertebrate eye, no blind spot exists, because the optic nerve is positioned
        behind the retina. They are capable of using stereopsis, enabling them to discern depth/distance because their
        brain calculates the input from both eyes.
    </p>

    <h3>Cuttlebone</h3>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish possess an internal structure called the cuttlebone, which is porous and is made of aragonite. The
        pores provide it with buoyancy, which the cuttlefish regulates by changing the gas-to-liquid ratio in the
        chambered cuttlebone via the ventral siphuncle.[21] Each species' cuttlebone has a distinct shape, size, and
        pattern of ridges or texture. The cuttlebone is unique to cuttlefish, and is one of the features that
        distinguish them from their squid relatives.[22]
